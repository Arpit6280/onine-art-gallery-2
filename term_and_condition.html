Purchasing Art<br><br>

You must be a Registered User in order to purchase the Art. Buyers are obligated to complete the sale transaction upon completion of the check-out process. Placing an order on artzolo.com constitutes an irrevocable acceptance of the purchase once the shipment has been made by the seller or if the artwork is in transit. Unless rescinded/cancelled by ArtZolo on account of a default by the artist or any prior or continuing breach by the buyer, such acceptance results in an enforceable contract of sale. The contract of sale is between ArtZolo (acting as the agent of the artist) and the buyer.<br>

All artwork posted for sale by Artists on the Website is supported by an authenticity guarantee from the Artist themselves. ArtZolo does not issue any authenticity guarantee.<br><br>

Refunds<br><br>

The artworks will be delivered/shipped to the Buyer directly by the Artist through a courier service selected either by the seller or by ArtZolo.  ArtZolo is in no way liable for the condition of the artwork at any point in transit/delivery process. Should there be any damage to the artwork in transit the Buyer should not accept the parcel and should notify ArtZolo immediately. Artworks received in an unsatisfactory condition by the buyer may be returned to the Artist within 5 working days in an 'as is' condition of order receipt in the original packaging along with a copy of your invoice or order acknowledgement. Original shipping charges are not refunded on returned items. Customers are responsible for all shipping charges back to ArtZolo on returned items, and ArtZolo will pay the shipping charges on replacement product(s). Returns can be for replacement, refund or credit at ArtZolo's discretion. If your return merchandise is accepted, we will post a credit to your account within 5 - 10 business days from the time that we receive the product(s). Each return is credited in the same manner as payment. For example, if you paid for your order with a credit card, the credit will be applied to that card.<br><br>

However, the unsatisfactory condition will only be covered for damaged or spoilt condition, and NOT because the buyer did not like the artwork that they have purchased.<br><br>

While great care is taken to reproduce the colours and form of paintings as depicted on the website, it is understood that since each painting is individually painted there may be variations in shade and colour. No complaints in this regard would be entertained. ArtZolo is not obligated to provide any physical preview of the artwork either before or after the sale.<br><br><br>

 

Return Process<br><br>

If a buyer elects to return a piece of Art (only if met by our Refund policy norms), the buyer must write to ArtZolo.com with the photographs of the damage and an email specifying the damage. We shall debit seller for the Purchase Fees less any insurance, packing, freight and transport fees associated with buyer's purchase. Reimbursement shall be made by issuing a credit card refund if payment to artzolo.com was made by credit card or by check if payment was made by check. Insurance, packing and shipping fees associated with the return of the returned piece of Art shall be the sole responsibility of the buyer, and artzolo.com shall have no obligation to reimburse the buyer for such amounts.<br><br><br>
